# ML-in-Production-

Created and deployed a Deep Learning algorithm into a production REST API micro-service using Python, Keras, FastAPI & NoSQL.
Built a Production-grade machine learning REST API using AWS and DataStax AstraDB(Cassandra) to store and retain our inference results. 
Project has automated build to download datasets from cloud, process data and train model using set of notebooks. 
Uses FastAPI and AstraDB to use created model as an api and store inference results.
